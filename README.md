# ðŸŽ“ Student Performance Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts final grades of students using a dataset from UCI.  
Two ML models were used: **Random Forest** and **SVM**, with Random Forest achieving ~85% RÂ² score.

## ðŸ“Œ Technologies Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ“ˆ Results
- Trained and tested models using student attributes
- Visualized actual vs predicted grades
- Learned end-to-end model development process
